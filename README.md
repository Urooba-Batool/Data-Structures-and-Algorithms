# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repo is dedicated to all my work, notes, and code implementations related to DSA. I am building it as a structured, topic-wise resource to help me (and others) understand and practice DSA concepts in a clean and organized way.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
The repository is organized topic-wise. Each topic will have:  
- 📁 **Separate Folder** – containing all related files  
- 📝 **Description/Notes** – a short explanation of the concept  
- 💻 **Code Implementations** – sample code for better understanding  

```bash

```

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository  
- 📌 Build a **comprehensive reference** for DSA concepts  
- 📌 Practice coding problems topic by topic  
- 📌 Make the repo beginner-friendly for future learners  
- 📌 Track my personal progress in mastering DSA
